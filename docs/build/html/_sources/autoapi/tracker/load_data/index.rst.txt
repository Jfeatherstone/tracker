.. py:function:: loadAntData(inputPath, minimumLength=10, smoothingWindow=10, maximumTimeSkip=10, excludeOutliers=True, excludeShortSegments=True, excludeObjects=False, borderPadding=None, inverseBorderPadding=None, debug=False)

   
   Load in ant trajectory data, preprocessed by the file ``00_PreprocessData.ipynb``.

   While the SLEAP model that tracks the videos has multiple keypoints,
   the preprocessing averages those three keypoints to get the center of
   mass over time. You can explore the individual keypoint trajectories
   if you would like using the raw sleap files, but they are much more
   susceptible to discretization and jitter.

   By default, the trajectory is smoothed as discussed in the manuscript.
   This can be adjusted if you'd like with the ``smoothingWindow`` parameter.

   Gaps in the trajectory are also removed; this can be adjusted by
   changing the ``maximumTimeSkip`` parameter.

   You can remove parts of the trajectory that are close to the boundary
   as desired using the ``borderPadding`` or ``inverseBorderPadding`` (for
   only keeping data around the boundary). The boundary is computed for
   each individual trajectory.

   If part of a segment goes near the boundary, that segment will be
   split into multiple pieces to avoid having a large gap(s) in the middle.

   :Parameters:

       **inputPath** : str
           Path to the input h5 file.

       **minimumLength** : float
           The minimum length of a segment (in seconds) that will
           be included in the returned list of segments.
           
           Only has an effect if `excludeShortSegments=True`.
           
           Note that this value is given in *seconds*, or whatever the native
           unit of time for the trajectory is.

       **smoothingWindow** : int
           The size of the smoothing window applied to the trajectory
           data.
           
           Note that this value is given in *frames* (or steps, indices, etc.),
           not the native time unit of the trajectories.

       **maximumTimeSkip** : int
           The maximum amount of frames that are allowed to be skipped
           without breaking up a trajectory into multiple pieces. Note
           that this value is given in *frames* (or steps, indices, etc.),
           not the native time unit of the trajectories.

       **excludeOutliers** : bool
           Whether to exclude trials annotated as an outlier during the
           preprocessing. For more information on why trials might be
           annotated as an outlier, see file `00_PreprocessData.ipynb`.

       **excludeShortSegments** : bool
           Whether to apply the provided value of `minimumLength` as a
           cutoff for the length of segments.

       **excludeObjects** : bool
           Whether to exclude trials that had an object in the enclosure, 
           including food, water, etc.

       **borderPadding** : float, optional
           The size of padding around the borders of the arena to ignore.
           If a segment is partly contained in this region, only the points
           which actually fall in the region are deleted.
           
           Be careful when calculating speeds, angle turns, etc., as you will
           have to make sure to ignore the times when the process jumps. The
           array `timeArr` can be used to determine when this is necessary.

       **inverseBorderPadding** : float, optional
           The size of padding around the borders of the arena to keep.
           Any points that are part of a segment that deviate from this
           region will be deleted, keeping only the trajectories near the
           boundary.
           
           Be careful when calculating speeds, angle turns, etc., as you will
           have to make sure to ignore the times when the process jumps. The
           array `timeArr` can be used to determine when this is necessary.

       **debug** : bool
           Whether to show progress bars during the loading process.



   :Returns:

       **dataArr** : list of np.array[N_i, 2]
           The list of positions of the ant throughout time for each segment.

       **timeArr** : list of np.array[N_i]
           The list of time points at which each position in dataArr[i] is
           sampled. The first data point is the actual time within
           the original video at which this trajectory starts, and thus can
           be used to determine the order of segments within a trial.

       **metadataArr** : list of dict
           The dictionaries containing metadata information about the tracking
           procedure, experimental conditions, and preprocessing steps for
           each segment.
