.. py:function:: trackSleapFile(datasetPath, interpolationLength=10, minScore=0.4, maxDistance=np.inf)

   
   Load in a SLEAP tracking file (.slp) and extract the trajectory
   information from it.

   This function will ignore any tracks currently present in the
   data, and generate new ones, assuming that there is only a
   single individual across the whole video. This is done using a
   very simple custom tracking algorithm:

       Add the position of the instance closest to the previous
       frame to the trajectory.

       If the previous frame(s) are missing, but there is a valid
       frame less than X frames ago, add the position closest to
       that previous one, and linearly interpolate the missing points.

       Otherwise, take the instance in the frame that has the best
       prediction score.

   I think this is a flexible algorithm that is able to interpolate to
   fill in small gaps, but doesn't introduce too many artifacts
   from interpolation. The value of X above is the param
   `interpolationLength`.

   There is really not a lot of documentation how to work directly
   with the .slp project files, so I had to really experiment
   to get this to work well. I guess the alternative is to properly
   export each project as an h5 file, but I didn't want to have
   to do that for each and every file I have.

   For more information about this function (and how it is used) see the
   notebook ``00_Preprocessing.ipynb``.
