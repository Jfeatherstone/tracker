``tracker``
============

This library includes the computational tools associated with Featherstone
et al. (2026). Beyond sharing the code used in analyzing the data associated
data, we also include several tutorials on how the tracking is performed, and
how to work with the data yourself.


Installation
------------

The package can be installed from source:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/jfeatherstone/tracker
    $ cd tracker
    $ pip install .


Usage
-----

The API documentation describes how to directly use the library if you are
already familiar with Python.


Tutorials
---------

All of the tutorials are written assuming you are on a linux system (since
that is what I use). In theory, other operating systems should be almost
exactly the same with the exception of the first tutorial on setting things up.
